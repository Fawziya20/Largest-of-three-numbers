# Largest-of-three-numbers
## Aim:
To write a C# program to find the largest of three numbers

## Algorithm:
### Step1: 
Start
### Step2:
Create a class and declare three variable with integer datatype
### Step3:
Use if condition to check whether num1 is largest than num2 and num3
### Step4:
Use elif condition to check whether num2 is largest than num1 and num3
### Step5:
Use else condition to display that third variable is largest among all the variables
### Step6:
stop

## Program:

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the C# program to find the largest of three numbers is executed successfully
